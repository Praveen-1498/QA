<h2 align="left"> With 5+ years of experience in Manual and Functionality Testing in Consoles and Mobile Games   I am a qualified game tester professional known for efficiency and rapid learning. Experienced in mobile, web, and console testing. I excel in the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and Defect Life Cycle, showcasing proficiency in test execution, test data creation, and JIRA-based defect reporting. I collaborate effectively with development and testing teams, specializing in exploratory and compatibility testing.
My responsibilities involve crafting thorough test scenarios, meticulous test data preparation, and precise defect reporting to clients. I excel at documentation, generating reports like Daily Status Reports (DSR) and Test Case Execution Reports. As a key player in training and mentoring new team members, I contribute to team growth and knowledge transfer.
Adaptable and quick to integrate into new environments, I bring a proactive approach to learning new technologies.</h2>
